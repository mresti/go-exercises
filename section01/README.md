# Section01

In this section, I have some exercises about:

- *exercise1*: file ```exercise1.go``` has the function **Fizzbuzz**
- *exercise2*: file ```exercise2.go``` has the function **IsPrime**
- *exercise3*: file ```exercise3.go``` has the function **IsPalindrome**

*warning* My solutions can be improved.
